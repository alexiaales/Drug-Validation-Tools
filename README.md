# GUI for drug validation 
Classification and Clustering Tool
A tool for classification and clustering has been developed in the lab. The initial script can be found in the following link(https://github.com/alexiaales/drug-target-validation-/blob/master/READ_ME.docx). Since however these tools maybe used in the future from people who might not be familiar with programming a graphical interface was done in order to facilitate these users. 
Once the user runs the script a window will appear letting the user decide whether they want to forceed with a classification or clustering analysis.

If you have selected to do a classification analysis you will be asked to insert a training set and latter on the data you wish to classify your genes into.Once you provide these files,a window with the accuracy of each classifier will pop up on the right corner on your screen letting you know how each one of the 10 proposed classifiers performed on your training set. You will can then click with which classifier you would like to continue your analysis.In the end of the classification process a window will appear letting you know that the classification is completed.You can then visit your working directory to see the output files.

If on the other hand you have selected to do a clustering analysis then you will be only asked to provide the data you want to perform the clusering on an dof course the number of clusters you are interested in clustering you data into. Once these parameters have been set ,then once again you can visit your working directory to check your results.
